# Password Finder

To run this program, direct to the directory where the `main.py` file is stored and run it using the command `python main.py`

After running it, you will be asked to enter a password.

```
Enter password: 
```

Let's say we take *pi* as our password and hit enter.

```
Enter password: pi
```

Now the program will take some time to try every combination of characters in order to find the correct one for the word *pi*. The more charactes your password has, the more tries the program has to attempt in order to find it.

After it's done, the program will output the correct password as well as the time in seconds it needed to find it and the number of tries it attempted to find the password.

```
Done. The password is pi
